## Title
Unveiling Diversity in Wikipedia: Analysis of Human Dimensions Across Pages and Contributors

## Abstract
Digital technologies have dramatically transformed society, enhancing communication and access to information while also revealing and amplifying biases, particularly gender biases. Wikipedia, a major online reference, mirrors these disparities, with its contributor base predominantly male and limited female participation. This study investigates gender diversity within Wikipedia, focusing on both contributor demographics and content representation. By employing natural language processing, statistical analysis, and network theory, the research aims to uncover insights into gender influences on Wikipedia biographies and their linguistic characteristics. Text analysis showed that female contributors write fewer words in men’s biographies and emphasize gender in women’s articles and family and personal terms in general. Male editors associate women with family terms as well and use more abstract language that may emphasize undesirable attributes. Hyperlink network analysis revealed women’s Wikipedia articles are generally more isolated than men’s, hindering exploration of women personalities. Additionally, there’s limited connectivity between male and female biography pages, with women’s articles often linking to men’s, but not viceversa. These findings highlight ongoing gender gaps on Wikipedia, stressing the need for balanced representation to ensure less biased portrayals.
